For CSV files, it highlights different CSV columns in different colors.
Requires "CSV" pseudo lexer (empty) from Addon Manager, install this lexer first.

Also plugin handles hovering mouse over text: it shows index/caption of current CSV 
column in the statubar (caption is read from the 1st line).
