Plugin for CudaText.
For CSV files, it highlights different CSV columns in different colors.
Requires "CSV" pseudo lexer (empty) from Addon Manager, install this lexer first.

Also plugin handles hovering mouse over text: it shows index/caption of current CSV 
column in the statubar (caption is read from the 1st line).
