Plugin for CudaText.
For CSV (comma-separated values) and TSV (tab-separated values), plugin highlights
different columns in different colors.
Requires "CSV" and "TSV" pseudo lexers (plugin has these lexers as requirements
in Addon Manager, so they are usually auto-intalled).

Also plugin handles hovering mouse over text: it shows index/caption of current 
column in the statubar (caption is read from the first line).

Plugin has several commands for manage columns.

Plugin has several options in config file. Call config by menu "Options / Settings-plugins / CSV Helper".
